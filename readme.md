## next steps
 - collect representation of state and outcomes of valid actions

## latest
 - phi: choose valid action (i.e. taking account of which player is to act next) given state and expected payoff as a function of (a representation of) that state
 - rho: represent state as a vector
 - run game and collect state and outcomes on the way back up the tree i.e. after recursive calls
